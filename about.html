        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>This weather dashboard project was created to provide real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It also offers a 5-day weather forecast and information on previous weather cautions in the selected city.</p>
        <p>Using the OpenWeatherMap API, users can search for any city and get accurate weather data instantly.</p>
        <p>The goal of this mini-project is to create a Weather Dashboard that provides real-time weather data, along with additional features such as a 5-day forecast, previous weather cautions, and pages for general information (about, contact). This project involves web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a fully functional, responsive weather application.</p>
